# Booking-website.
Booking website with front- and backend.

# Created with Vite + React.
(NOTE: React with Vite was incorrectly installed last time (Sincerest apologies -Remi), this project upload should have a fixed
version of it, that runs properly on NPM RUN DEV command. Feel free to configure further if you run into issues.)

Please read up on how to use React appplications. Vite is a library tool that cuts up unnecessary files and components 
so a blank project can be started more easily. Front end focuses on the JSX, Html, CSS etc.

Refer to Trello https://trello.com/b/uz4a68bx/work-that-needs-to-be-done if it is unclear what needs to be done.

# Some helpful pointers if needed:

Front-end page components are all within src folder, 'index.html' will be the entry page of the application. Most front end components will
go into "App.jsx", and be displayed through a connection to 'index.html'. https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component might give insight to these components.

Home page will include 'Cards' acting as quick links to directory / search page with said destination already chosen for the user. Existing data in
'destinations.js' may be modified if it becomes inconvenient while creating directory page.
